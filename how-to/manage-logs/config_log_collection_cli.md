# Configuring the Log Analysis CLI (CF plugin) Deprecated
{: #config_log_collection_cli}

The {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service includes a command line interface (CLI) that you can use to manage your logs in the cloud.

The CLI offers different types of help: general help to learn about the CLI and supported commands, command help to learn how to use a command, or subcommand help to learn how to use a subcommands for a command.
