# Security
{: #security_ov}

To control the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} actions that a user is allowed to perform, you can assign one or more roles to a user. 
{:shortdesc}

To work with the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service API, you need to use a UAA token or an IAM token. To send logs into the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service, you need a logging token.


## Authentication models
{: #auth}

To work with the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service through the CLI or the API, you need an authentication token.

The {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service supports the following authentication models:

* [UAA authentication](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/security/auth_uaa.html#auth_uaa)

    You can only use the CLI to manage UAA tokens.
	
* [IAM Authentication](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/security/auth_iam.html#auth_iam)

    The IAM authentication model offers UI, CLI, or API management capabilities. 

**Note:** A UAA token and an IAM token expire after a period of time. 

## Roles
{: #roles}

There are two types of roles in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} that control the actions users can do when they work with the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service:

* Cloud Foundry (CF) roles: You control what {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} actions a user can do by assigning one or more CF roles. With these roles, you control the user's permissions to view and manage logs in a space or in an organization.
* IAM roles: You control what {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} actions a user can do by assigning one or more IAM roles. With these roles, you control the user's permissions to view and manage account logs. 


The following table lists the type of roles and the domain in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} that they control:

## Getting an authentication token to manage logs by using the API
{: #get_token}

To manage logs by using the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} API, you must use an authentication token. 

**Working with logs that are available in the space domain**

* Use the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} CLI to get the UAA token. 
* The token has an expiration time. 

For more information, see [Getting the UAA token](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/security/auth_uaa.html#auth_uaa).

**Working with logs that are available in the account domain**

* Use the {{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI to get the IAM token. 
* The token has an expiration time. 

For more information, see [Getting the IAM token](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/security/auth_iam.html#auth_iam).


## Getting the logging token to send logs into Log Analysis
{: #get_logging_token}

To send logs into the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service, you need a logging token. 

To send logs to a space domain, choose any of the following methods:

* [Getting the logging token to send logs to a space by using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} command ibmcloud service ](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/security/logging_token.html#logging_token_cloud_cli)
* [Getting the logging token to send logs to a space by using the Log Analysis CLI](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/security/logging_token.html#logging_token_la_cloud_cli)
* [Getting the logging token to send logs to a space by using the Log Analysis API](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/security/logging_token.html#logging_token_api)


## Granting permissions to a user to work with logs
{: #grant_permissions}

For a user to be able to manage logs, or to view logs, the user must be granted permissions in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} to work with the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service.

* For information about permissions required to manage logs, see [Roles that are required by a user to manage logs](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/manage_logs.html#roles).
* For information about permissions required to view logs, see [Roles that are required by a user to view logs](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/kibana/analyzing_logs_Kibana.html#roles).

For more information on how to grant permissions, see:

* [Assign an IAM policy to a user through the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} UI](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/security/grant_permissions.html#grant_permissions).
* [Assign an IAM policy to a user by using the command line](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/security/grant_permissions.html#grant_permissions_commandline).
* [Granting a user permissions to view space logs by using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} UI](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/security/grant_permissions.html#grant_permissions_ui_space).
