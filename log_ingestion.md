# Sending logs from outside the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}
{: #log_ingestion}

You can send logs from outside the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Cloud into the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service by using the multi-tenant Logstash Forwarder. 
{:shortdesc}

This feature is only available for service plans that allow log ingestion. For more information, see [Service plans](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/log_analysis_ov.html#plans).

To send logs from outside the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Cloud into the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service, you need the following Cloud resources:

* An {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}ID to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. This user ID must have permissions to work with the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service in a space in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. The space is the domain in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} where you plan to send and analyze logs.
* A logging token that is generated by using the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} CLI and is used to authenticate your local environment with the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service.  

In your local environment, you must configure the mt-logstash-forwarder, and specify the log files that you want to send to the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service.

For more information about configuring your local environment to send logs to the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service, see [Sending on-premises data to a space in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/how-to/send-data/send_data_mt.html#send_data_mt).
