# Granting permissions
{: #grant_permissions}

In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}, you can assign one or more roles to users. These roles define what tasks are enabled for that user to work with the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service. 
{:shortdesc}



## Assign an IAM policy to a user through the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} UI
{: #grant_permissions_ui_account}

To grant a user permissions to view and manage account logs, you must add a policy for that user that describes the actions that this user can do with the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service in the account. Only account owners can assign individual policies to users.

In {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, complete the following steps to grant a user permissions to work with the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service:

1. Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console.

    Open a web browser and launch the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard: [http://bluemix.net ![External link icon](../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://bluemix.net){:new_window}
	
	After you log in with your user ID and password, the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} UI opens.

2. From the menu bar, click **Manage > Account > Users**. 

    The *Users* window displays a list of users with their email addresses for the currently selected account.
	
3. If the user is a member of the account, select the user name from the list, or click **Manage user** from the *Actions* menu.

    If the user is not a member of the account, see [Inviting users](/docs/iam/iamuserinv.html#iamuserinv).

4. In the **Access policies** section, click **Assign service policies**, then select **Assign access to resources**..

    The *Assign resource access to user** window opens.

5. Enter information about the policy. The following table lists the fields that are required to define a policy: 

    <table>
	  <caption>List of fields to configure an IAM policy.</caption>
	  <tr>
	    <th>Field</th>
		<th>Value</th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Services</td>
		<td>*IBM Cloud Log Analysis*</td>
	  </tr>	  
	  <tr>
	    <td>Regions</td>
		<td>You can specify the regions where the user is going to be granted access to work with logs. Select one or more regions individually, or select **All current regions** to grant access to all regions.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Service instance</td>
		<td>Select *All service instances*.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Roles</td>
		<td>Select one or more IAM roles. <br>Valid roles are: *administrator*, *operator*, *editor*, and *viewer*. <br>For more information about the actions that are allowed per role, see [IAM roles](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/security_ov.html#iam_roles).
		</td>
	  </tr>
     </table>
	
6. Click **Assign policy**.
	
The policy that you configure is applicable to the selected regions. 

## Assign an IAM policy to a user by using the command line
{: #grant_permissions_commandline}

To grant a user permissions to view and manage account logs, you must grant the user an IAM role. For more information about IAM roles and what tasks are enabled by role to work with the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service, see [IAM roles](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/security_ov.html#iam_roles).

This operation can be performed only by the account owner.

Complete the following steps to grant a user access to view account logs by using the command line:

1. Get the account ID. 

    Run the following command to get the account ID:

    ```
	bx iam accounts
	```
    {: codeblock}	

	A list of accounts with their GUIDs is displayed.
	
	Export the account ID of the account where you plan to grant permissions to a user to a shell variable such as `$acct_id`, for example:
	
	```
	export acct_id="1234567891234567812341234123412"
	```
	{: screen}

2. Get the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} ID of the user to whom you want to grant permissions.

    1. Display the users that are associated with the account. Run the following command:
	
	    ```
		bx iam account-users
		```
		{: codeblock}
		
	2. Get the GUID of the user. **Note:** This step must be completed by the user to whom you plan to grant permissions.
	
	    For example, request the user to run the following commands to get his user ID:
		
		Get the IAM token. For more information, see [Getting the IAM token by using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/security/auth_iam.html#iam_token_cli).

        Get the data from the IAM token that is between the first 2 dots in the IAM token. Export the data to a shell variable such as `$user_data`. 
		
		```
	    export user_data="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
	    ```
	    {: screen}
		
		Run the following command, for example, to get the user ID. This command uses jq in this sample to decode the information into JSON formatted text:
		
		```
		echo $user_data | base64 -d | jq
		```
		{: codeblock}
		
		The output of running this command is the following:
		
		```
		$ echo $user_data | base64 -d | jq
        {
        "iam_id": "IBMid-xxxxxxxxxx",
        "id": "IBMid-xxxxxxxxxx",
        "realmid": "IBMid",
        ......
		}
        ```
	    {: screen}
		
		Send the user ID to the account owner.
		
	3. Export the user ID to a shell variable such as `$user_ibm_id`.
	
		```
		export user_ibm_id="IBMid-xxxxxxxxxx"
		```
		{: codeblock}

3. Invite the user to the account if it is not already a member. For more information, see [Inviting users](/docs/iam/iamuserinv.html#iamuserinv).

    For example, run the following command to invite user xxx@yyy.com to the account zzz@ggg.com:
	
	```
	bx iam account-user-invite xxx@yyy.com zzz@ggg.com OrgAuditor dev SpaceDeveloper
	```
	{: codeblock}
		
4. Create a policy file name. 

    For example, use the following template to grant view permissions in the US South region:
	
	```
	{
		"roles" : [
			{
				"id": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Editor" 
			}
		],
		"resources": [
			{
				"serviceName": "ibmcloud-log-analysis",
				"region": "us-south"
			}
		]
	}
	```
	{: codeblock}
	
	Name the policy file: `policy.json`
	
5. Get the IAM token for your user ID.

    For more information, see [Getting the IAM token by using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/security/auth_iam.html#iam_token_cli).

    Export the IAM token to a shell variable such as `$iam_token`, for example:
	
	```
	export iam_token="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
	```
	{: screen}
	
6. Grant the user permissions to work with the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort}} service. 

   Run the following cURL command to grant permissions in the US South region:
	
    ```
	curl -X POST --header "Authorization: $iam_token" --header "Content-Type: application/json" https://iampap.ng.bluemix.net/acms/v1/scopes/a%2F$acct_id/users/$user_ibm_id/policies -d @policy.json
	```
	{: codeblock}
	
	Run the following cURL command to grant permissions in the United Kingdom region:
	
    ```
	curl -X POST --header "Authorization: $iam_token" --header "Content-Type: application/json" https://iampap.eu-gb.bluemix.net/acms/v1/scopes/a%2F$acct_id/users/$user_ibm_id/policies -d @policy.json
	```
	{: codeblock}

	
After you grant permissions to a user, the user can log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, and see account level logs.



## Granting a user permissions to view space logs by using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} UI
{: #grant_permissions_ui_space}
