# Navigating to the logs of a Cloud Foundry app
{: #launch_logs_cloud_ui_cf}

In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} UI, you can view, filter, and analyze logs through the log tab that is available for each Cloud Foundry app.
{:shortdesc}

To see the deployment or runtime logs of a Cloud Foundry app, complete the following steps:

1. From the Apps dashboard, click the name of your Cloud Foundry app. 
    
2. From the app details page, click **Logs**.
    
    From the **Logs** tab, you can view the recent logs for your app or tail logs in real time. In addition, you can filter logs by component (log type), by app instance ID, and by error.
    
By default, the logs that are available for analysis from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console include data for the last 24 hours.

**Tip:** To analyze data for a custom period that precedes the last 24 hours, see [Advanced log analysis with Kibana](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/kibana/analyzing_logs_Kibana.html#analyzing_logs_Kibana).
